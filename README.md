# About

Cosmagia is a sandbox game that allows players to place gravitational sources like stars, and place and throw
objects that orbit or fall into them. Because the physics are accelerated by your graphics card, this game
can handle thousands of particles simultaneously while running at 60 frames per second.

It is currently in early Alpha stages so many features are missing.
